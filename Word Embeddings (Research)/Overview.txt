(but let me know you this code used w2v, we will use this code for Downstream tasks such as Toxicity detection and on three others tasks ( POS NER, POS TAGGING, POS CHUNKING)

.Debiasing Tecniques : Hard-Debias (HARD) method (Bolukbasi et al., 2016)
Gender-Neutral GloVe (GN-GloVe) method (Zhao et al., 2018)
Gender-Preserving GloVe (GP-GloVe) method (Kaneko and Bollegala, 2019)
Half-Sibling Regression (HSR) method (Yang and Feng, 2019)
Double-Hard Debias (DHD) method (Wang et al., 2020)
Repulsion-Attraction-Neutralisation (RAN) method (Kumar et al., 2020)
GP-GN-GloVe and HSR-RAN-GloVe methods

.To compare all the methods, the following measures have been considered and are described later:
(1) Average direct bias (Bias)
(2) 5 tasks presented by Gonen and Golbderg in Lipstick on a pig_debiasing methods cover up systematic gender bias in word embedding (Bias)
(3)SemBias data set, presented by Zhao et al., (Sembias)
(4) word similarity tasks (WS_STS)
(5) semantic textual similarity tasks

.Quantifying gender bias: Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)
SemBias Anaology test 
Word Similarity 
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)

.Gender bias word relation task performance: 
Clustering, Correlation, Profession, Classification, Association, (Here we will add our 2 task from Paper 1 (Toxicity detection and POS NER, POS TAGGING, POS CHUNKING)

softWEAT

.Evaluation Metrics:
Relative Negative Sentiment Bias(RNSB) Metric
Mean Average Cosine Similarity (MAC) Metric
Word Association Evaluation Test (WEAT) effect size Metric
