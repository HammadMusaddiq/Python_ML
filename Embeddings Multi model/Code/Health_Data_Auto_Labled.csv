Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009
The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (GIPA Act) provides a proactive, open approach to gaining access to government information in New South Wales (NSW). The objects of the GIPA Act are to maintain and advance a system of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open, accountable, fair and effective.

The GIPA Act:

authorises and encourages the proactive release of information by NSW public sector agencies;
gives members of the public a legally enforceable right to access government information; and
ensures that access to government information is restricted only when there is an overriding public interest against releasing that information.
The GIPA Act applies to all NSW government agencies, and also extends to Ministers and their staff, local councils, state-owned corporations, courts in their non-judicial functions, and to certain public authorities, such as universities.

The guiding principle of the GIPA Act is the public interest. It is generally presumed that all government agencies will disclose or release information, unless there is an overriding public interest against doing so. Under the GIPA Act it is compulsory for agencies to provide information about their structure, functions and policies, and agencies are encouraged to proactively and informally release as much other information as possible.

Under the GIPA Act there are four ways that SESLHD can make information available to the public:

Mandatory release
State and local Government agencies are required to publish specific open access information on their website, free of charge. For example, this could include a register of government contracts, policies, media releases and annual reports. 
  Proactive release
State and local Government agencies are encouraged to make as much other information as possible publicly available in an appropriate manner, including on the internet. The information should be available free of charge or at the lowest reasonable cost. For example, frequently requested information or information of public interest may be readily available.
Informal release
State and local Government agencies are authorised to release other information in response to an informal request, subject to any reasonable conditions an agency imposes. For example, such information could include requests for personal information by the individual concerned.

Formal release
State and local Government agencies may release information in response to a formal access application. This involves making a written application and paying a fee.

Information which may not be disclosed

An access application cannot be made for information specifically excluded under Schedule 2 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services.

For some categories of information, while an access application may be made there is a presumption against release. The list of categories is set out at Schedule 1 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services

GIPA Application Form
Agency Information Guide
SESLHD GIPA Annual Report

What exceptions are there to this rule?
The SESLHD will collect, use and disclose more extensive information than stated above in the following circumstances:

unauthorised attempts to access files which are not published SESLHD pages; 
unauthorised tampering or interference with files published on the SESLHD site; 
unauthorised attempts to index the contents of the SESLHD site by other sites; 
attempts to intercept messages of other users of the SESLHD site; 
communications which are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups or which give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed; and 
attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the web server, breach the laws of the State of New South Wales or Commonwealth of Australia, or interfere with the enjoyment of the SESLHD site by other users. 
SESLHD reserves the right to make disclosures to relevant authorities where the use of the SESLHD site raises a suspicion that an offence is being, or has been, committed. In the event of an investigation SESLHD will provide access to data to any law enforcement agency that may exercise a warrant to inspect our logs. 
Is the information stored securely?
Yes. Information collected is stored in an appropriately secure format and held by SESLHD for archival purposes. When the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected it is deleted.

What will we do with information provided in Feedback?
SESLHD provides a feedback facility on the SESLHD site to allow users to provide input into the future development of the site and to comment on the provision of service by SESLHD.

The provision of personal details on feedback is optional. Users may provide personal details for the purpose of receiving a reply to their feedback. This information will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided. We will not add your email address or name to any mailing list. SESLHD may publish aggregated information about feedback on the site, to the extent that it does not identify or cannot be used to identify individual users.
 

Will this policy be updated over time?
Due to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication, this policy may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or issues that may arise from time to time. The amended policy will be posted to this site and will operate from the time it is posted.
 

Privacy of patient information
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (SESLHD) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of patient information and has implemented measures to comply with its obligations under the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (HRIPA) and the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998.

All staff members working in the NSW public health system, including doctors, nurses and other staff, are bound by law, by the NSW Health Privacy Policy and by a strict code of conduct to maintain confidentiality of patient information.

Information about your rights under HRIPA is outlined in the Privacy Brochure (Multilingual Patient Privacy Brochures). If you believe a health service provider involved in your care has contravened a Health Privacy Principle or Health Privacy Code, you may wish to request an internal review of the incident.

Privacy Information for Staff. ------------------------ Right to Information
Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009
The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (GIPA Act) provides a proactive, open approach to gaining access to government information in New South Wales (NSW). The objects of the GIPA Act are to maintain and advance a system of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open, accountable, fair and effective.

The GIPA Act:

authorises and encourages the proactive release of information by NSW public sector agencies;
gives members of the public a legally enforceable right to access government information; and
ensures that access to government information is restricted only when there is an overriding public interest against releasing that information.
The GIPA Act applies to all NSW government agencies, and also extends to Ministers and their staff, local councils, state-owned corporations, courts in their non-judicial functions, and to certain public authorities, such as universities.

The guiding principle of the GIPA Act is the public interest. It is generally presumed that all government agencies will disclose or release information, unless there is an overriding public interest against doing so. Under the GIPA Act it is compulsory for agencies to provide information about their structure, functions and policies, and agencies are encouraged to proactively and informally release as much other information as possible.

Under the GIPA Act there are four ways that SESLHD can make information available to the public:

Mandatory release
State and local Government agencies are required to publish specific open access information on their website, free of charge. For example, this could include a register of government contracts, policies, media releases and annual reports. 
  Proactive release
State and local Government agencies are encouraged to make as much other information as possible publicly available in an appropriate manner, including on the internet. The information should be available free of charge or at the lowest reasonable cost. For example, frequently requested information or information of public interest may be readily available.
Informal release
State and local Government agencies are authorised to release other information in response to an informal request, subject to any reasonable conditions an agency imposes. For example, such information could include requests for personal information by the individual concerned.

Formal release
State and local Government agencies may release information in response to a formal access application. This involves making a written application and paying a fee.

Information which may not be disclosed

An access application cannot be made for information specifically excluded under Schedule 2 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services.

For some categories of information, while an access application may be made there is a presumption against release. The list of categories is set out at Schedule 1 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services

"North Shore Private Hospital: RAMSAY HEALTH CARE AUSTRALIA
PRIVACY STATEMENT
Ramsay Health Care Australia (Ramsay) is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and other relevant laws about how private health service providers handle personal information (including but not limited to patient health information).

We are committed to complying with all applicable privacy laws which govern how Ramsay collects, uses, discloses and stores your personal information.

This Privacy Statement sets out in brief how Ramsay facilities (inpatient and outpatient services) will handle your personal information. For further information or to receive a copy of our full Privacy Policy, please ask a staff member, visit our website: www.ramsayhealth.com or telephone the Ramsay facility and ask to speak with our Privacy Officer. You can also write to our Privacy Officer to request more information.

In respect of Patients, Ramsay will collect your personal information for the purpose of providing you with health care and for directly related purposes. For example, Ramsay may collect, use or disclose personal information:

For use by a multidisciplinary treating team;
Assessment for provision of health care services;
To liaise with health professionals, care coordinator, Medicare, your health fund or other third party payer;
In an emergency where your life is at risk and you cannot consent;
To manage Ramsay facilities, including for processes relating to risk management, safety and security activities and quality assurance and accreditation activities;
For the education of health care workers or the placement of students or trainees at Ramsay facilities;
To maintain medical records as required under our policies and by law; or
For other purposes required or permitted by law.
In respect of other individuals, Ramsay will collect your personal information in order to engage with you in your dealings with Ramsay and for other related purposes.

Personal information may be shared between Ramsay facilities to coordinate your care. We also outsource some of our services. This may involve us sharing your personal information with third parties. For example, we outsource the conduct of our patient satisfaction surveys to a contractor who may write to you seeking feedback about your experience with Ramsay.

We may outsource information and data storage services (including archiving of medical records), which may involve storing that information outside of Australia. Where we outsource our services we take reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that third parties, including organisations outside of Australia, have obligations under their contracts with Ramsay to comply with all laws relating to the privacy (including security) and confidentiality of your personal information.

Ramsay will usually collect your personal information directly from you, but sometimes may need to collect it from a third party. We will only do this if you have consented or where it is not reasonable or practical for us to collect this information directly from you (for example, in relation to a patient, your life is at risk and we need to provide emergency treatment).

We will not use or disclose your personal information to any other persons or organisations for any other purpose unless:

You have consented;
For patients/clients, the use or disclosure is for a purpose directly related to providing you with health care and you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information in this way;
For other individuals, the use or disclosure is for a purpose related to providing you with services and you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information in this way;
We have told you that we will disclose your personal information to other organisations or persons; or
We are permitted or required to do so by law.
You have the right to access your personal information that we hold about you (for patients, this includes health information contained in your health record). You can also request an amendment to personal information that we hold about you should you believe that it contains inaccurate information.

Accessing Other Information held by WSLHD
The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (GIPA Act) replaced the Freedom of Information Act 1989 (NSW) from 1 July 2010, introducing new right to information reforms that focus on making government information more readily available. The GIPA Act applies to all NSW government agencies, including WSLHD. The new right to information laws promotes openness, accountability and transparency and makes government agencies more proactive in providing information to the public.

Under the the GIPA Act there are four ways that government information will be released:

Mandatory release

State and local Government agencies are required to publish specific open access information on their website, free of charge. For example, this could include a register of government contracts, policies and annual reports.

You can view the resources page for more details on this type of information.

Proactive release

You can ask WSLHD what information it will make available to the public, in addition to the information contained on its website. Under the GIPA Act, WSLHD is encouraged to release as much information as possible, in an appropriate way and free of charge (or at the lowest reasonable cost). The Media and Communications Unit can be contacted on 02 8890 8258 during business hours.

Informal release

You can request specific information from WSLHD. WSLHD will release information without the need for a formal application, unless there are good reasons to require one. Your first point of contact should be the Media and Communications Unit on 02 8890 8258 during business hours.

Formal release

Formal release is the last resort.  If you haven't been able to get the information you need in any other way you can formally request specific information from WSLHD. In limited circumstances, access to information will require a formal access application.

 

Making a Formal Application for Information under the GIPA Act
A formal application for information must:

be in writing. A formal request may be made with the application form provided by WSLHD GIPA Act Access Application Form (PDF)
clearly indicate that it is an access application made under the GIPA Act
be accompanied by a fee of $30.00 which may be reduced by 50% in cases of financial hardship or for special benefit to the public
state a postal address in Australia as the address for correspondence in connection with the application
include enough information to enable the information requested to be identified
Processing charges may also apply, however, if there will be considerable additional costs incurred by your formal access application under the GIPA Act, you will be advised of the estimated costs before the work starts.

WSLHD may ask for a 50% advance deposit from you if the cost estimated for the work to be undertaken is an amount that exceeds the application fee. If you do not pay this deposit WSLHD may not proceed with the request.

Once a WSLHD officer has made a decision on your access application you will be notified of the outcome of your request. If access is not provided, either in whole or in part because there is an overriding public interest against disclosure, you will be advised of the reasons for this decision.

You can post your application form to or lodge it with:

Privacy Information for Staff. ----------------------------- Right to Information
Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009
The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (GIPA Act) provides a proactive, open approach to gaining access to government information in New South Wales (NSW). The objects of the GIPA Act are to maintain and advance a system of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open, accountable, fair and effective.

The GIPA Act:

authorises and encourages the proactive release of information by NSW public sector agencies;
gives members of the public a legally enforceable right to access government information; and
ensures that access to government information is restricted only when there is an overriding public interest against releasing that information.
The GIPA Act applies to all NSW government agencies, and also extends to Ministers and their staff, local councils, state-owned corporations, courts in their non-judicial functions, and to certain public authorities, such as universities.

The guiding principle of the GIPA Act is the public interest. It is generally presumed that all government agencies will disclose or release information, unless there is an overriding public interest against doing so. Under the GIPA Act it is compulsory for agencies to provide information about their structure, functions and policies, and agencies are encouraged to proactively and informally release as much other information as possible.

Under the GIPA Act there are four ways that SESLHD can make information available to the public:

Mandatory release
State and local Government agencies are required to publish specific open access information on their website, free of charge. For example, this could include a register of government contracts, policies, media releases and annual reports. 
  Proactive release
State and local Government agencies are encouraged to make as much other information as possible publicly available in an appropriate manner, including on the internet. The information should be available free of charge or at the lowest reasonable cost. For example, frequently requested information or information of public interest may be readily available.
Informal release
State and local Government agencies are authorised to release other information in response to an informal request, subject to any reasonable conditions an agency imposes. For example, such information could include requests for personal information by the individual concerned.

Formal release
State and local Government agencies may release information in response to a formal access application. This involves making a written application and paying a fee.

Information which may not be disclosed

An access application cannot be made for information specifically excluded under Schedule 2 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services.

For some categories of information, while an access application may be made there is a presumption against release. The list of categories is set out at Schedule 1 of the GIPA Act. For more details about information that may not be disclosed, please contact Executive Services

Accessing Other Information held by WSLHD
The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (GIPA Act) replaced the Freedom of Information Act 1989 (NSW) from 1 July 2010, introducing new right to information reforms that focus on making government information more readily available. The GIPA Act applies to all NSW government agencies, including WSLHD. The new right to information laws promotes openness, accountability and transparency and makes government agencies more proactive in providing information to the public.

Under the the GIPA Act there are four ways that government information will be released:

Mandatory release

State and local Government agencies are required to publish specific open access information on their website, free of charge. For example, this could include a register of government contracts, policies and annual reports.

You can view the resources page for more details on this type of information.

Proactive release

You can ask WSLHD what information it will make available to the public, in addition to the information contained on its website. Under the GIPA Act, WSLHD is encouraged to release as much information as possible, in an appropriate way and free of charge (or at the lowest reasonable cost). The Media and Communications Unit can be contacted on 02 8890 8258 during business hours.

You can request specific information from WSLHD. WSLHD will release information without the need for a formal application, unless there are good reasons to require one. Your first point of contact should be the Media and Communications Unit on 02 8890 8258 during business hours.

Formal release

Formal release is the last resort.  If you haven't been able to get the information you need in any other way you can formally request specific information from WSLHD. In limited circumstances, access to information will require a formal access application.

 

Making a Formal Application for Information under the GIPA Act
A formal application for information must:

be in writing. A formal request may be made with the application form provided by WSLHD GIPA Act Access Application Form (PDF)
clearly indicate that it is an access application made under the GIPA Act

We may share your contact details with the San Foundation. The San Foundation provides patients with information, newsletters and details about fundraising appeals. The San Foundation may use the information to contact you.
Chaplains
AHCL is a Christian organisation and we are committed to wholistic care, including your spiritual needs while you are receiving care.

Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights
The Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights describes the rights of patients and other people using the Australian health system. These rights are essential to make sure that, wherever and whenever care is provided, it is of high quality and is safe.

The Charter recognises that people receiving care and people providing care all have important parts to play in achieving healthcare rights. The Charter allows patients, consumers, families, carers and services providing health care to share an understanding of the rights of people receiving health care. This helps everyone to work together towards a safe and high quality health system. A genuine partnership between patients, consumers and providers is important so that everyone achieves the best possible outcomes.

Ramsay will usually collect your personal information directly from you, but sometimes may need to collect it from a third party.

"St John of God Burwood Hospital: St John of God Health Care Privacy Policy
Introduction
St John of God Health Care (SJGHC), including its Foundation, is committed to upholding the dignity of each person.  Guided by the value of respect, we will manage all personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme (NDB scheme) under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) and all other relevant Commonwealth and State legislation (together “Privacy Legislation”). This SJGHC Privacy Policy details how your personal information is collected, used, stored and disclosed by SJGHC and how you may contact us if you would like to access or correct your personal information. It also details how we respond if there is an Eligible Data Breach.

This privacy policy applies to all trading entities operated by SJGHC throughout Australia which are listed at www.sjog.org.au/contactus.  

A number of terms are used in this policy which have specific meanings as defined in the Privacy Act.

Personal information means “information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: 

whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.”
Some personal information is also classified as ‘sensitive information’. Sensitive information includes any personal information concerning a person’s race or ethnic origin, their political opinions, membership of political associations, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, biometric information used for automated biometric verification or biometric identification, biometric templates, health information and genetic information.  Sensitive information is afforded a higher degree of privacy protection and is subject to additional standards under the Privacy Act in relation to its handling.

Health information is a subset of personal information and is also considered to be sensitive information. Health information means: 

information or an opinion about:
the health, including an illness, disability or injury, (at any time) of an individual; or
an individual’s expressed wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her; or
a health service provided, or to be provided, to an individual; and other personal information collected to provide, or in providing, a health service to an individual; 
other personal information collected in connection with the donation, or intended donation, by an individual of his or her body parts, organs or body substances; or
genetic information about an individual in a form that is, or could be, predictive of the health of the individual or a genetic relative of the individual.

Information collected by SJGHC 

SJGHC collects personal information about individuals including patients, their relatives, employees, job applicants, contractors, vendors and suppliers, health professionals, students, volunteers and Foundation supporters.

SJGHC will only collect and hold personal information that is reasonably necessary for the performance of its services or obligations as an employer or accreditor of health practitioners. As a patient, we may collect information about your health history, family history, lifestyle, cultural or ethnic background and test results to assist in providing health care to you.  

If you are employed by SJGHC or if you have applied for a position at one of our facilities, we will often collect information about your work history, contact details, referees and any other information that you might submit in your job application. 

We collect similar background information about contractors, vendors, suppliers and health professionals who provide services to SJGHC and also about students and volunteers that attend at our facilities.  Where required, information from police checks, working with children checks and pre-employment medical screenings may also be collected. 

SJGHC usually collects your personal information directly from you and with your consent.  We will only collect your personal information from someone else if we have your consent, or if it is authorised or required by law, or if it is unreasonable or impracticable for us to collect that information from you, for example, where your life is at risk and you are unable to respond and we need your personal information in order to provide emergency treatment.

Use and Disclosure 

SJGHC will only use or disclose your personal information for the primary purposes for which it was collected or for directly related secondary purposes which you would reasonably expect (or about which we have told you) or as permitted or required by law.  If there is any doubt about this expectation then we will obtain your consent before using or disclosing your personal information for a secondary purpose. Apart from the uses listed in this policy or otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act, using or disclosing your personal information will only be done with your consent.

Sections 1-5 below identify the purposes for which we collect your personal information and sets out how we may use or disclose your personal information.

1. Provision of SJGHC services:

Personal information, including sensitive information, is collected by us for the primary purpose of ensuring patients and clients receive quality services whilst under our care. Accordingly, this information may need to be shared with other relevant people. Where necessary, your personal information, including your health information, may be collected from or disclosed to other health care providers, such as your general practitioner, home service provider or district health nurse or another hospital that may be involved in your ongoing care and/or services. 
In addition, aspects of your personal information we collect may be used or disclosed for other purposes, including: 

(a) Other health professionals: Some of the services provided within or by our facilities may be outsourced or provided by a contractor (i.e. physiotherapists or outpatient services). We may provide your personal information to them in order to assist in your care. Further, if you require certain medical devices or a prosthesis for your treatment, we may disclose your personal information to suppliers or manufacturers of those devices.  We require all such health professionals and contractors to handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and this policy.

(b) Relatives, guardian or legal representative:  Unless you have advised us not to disclose your health information, we may provide information about your condition to your next of kin, nominated relative, guardian or appointed legal representative. 

(c) Quality assurance: From time to time, we may need to collect, use or disclose aspects of your personal information to monitor the standard of health services provided, through processes such as accreditation and evaluation, clinical audits, risk and claims management, education and training of staff, and quality assurance activities, including monitoring clinical outcomes. This may include obtaining information from other health service providers.

(d) Patient satisfaction: To ensure we are delivering our services to meet our patients’ needs, we monitor patient satisfaction. As a result, we, or someone we authorise, may contact you in the future to request your feedback on our services. 

(e) Health service management: To aid the functioning of the health service, personal information of SJGHC patients may be used or disclosed to your health fund, Medicare and also to insurers, lawyers and your doctor for claims management.  This may include providing your information to other advisers in the ordinary course of managing our business, to support administrative functions incidental to providing the health services. 

(f) Billing: For billing and invoicing purposes, we may share relevant aspects of your personal information with third parties such as your other health care providers, Medicare, your private health insurance fund or external collection or account management agencies.

(g) Contractors: Depending on the requirements and resources available to SJGHC from time to time, we may engage third parties (such as IT suppliers, advisors and other professional service providers) to help us carry out our functions and activities and we may need to use and disclose your personal information in relation to these services. We require all such contractors to handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and where applicable this policy.

(h) Data required by law: We have legal obligations to provide information to various entities, for example if your medical record is subpoenaed or for compulsory reporting to State and Federal authorities. We may also provide your personal and health information to government agencies where we are providing health services under contracts with Government as required under those contracts. More information regarding these obligations is available on request.

(i) Direct marketing: We would like to use your personal information to contact you to provide marketing or promotional information in relation to other services we offer.  We will always comply with the privacy law when using or disclosing information for marketing purposes. If you would prefer not to be contacted, you may indicate this at any time.  

(j) St John of God Foundation (fundraising): As a not-for-profit group, SJGHC returns all profits to the community. The St John of God Foundation raises funds on behalf of SJGHC and relies on the generous support of the community to enable the delivery of better health outcomes, such as medical research, social outreach programs and major capital developments.  Therefore, we use our patients’ personal information to allow the St John of God Foundation, or someone it authorises, to contact you to provide information related to fundraising or community projects.  If you would prefer not to receive this information, you can indicate this.

(k) Research: SJGHC is committed to conducting research across a wide range of health fields with the aim of improving patient outcomes, public health and safety and teaching and otherwise as set out in the Privacy Act. SJGHC may use your health information for this purpose, which generally includes information contained in existing patient data, medical records and diagnoses by private specialists you have seen in the past. Only authorised persons will have access to your information.  We will not disclose your identity to unauthorised persons. 

(l) Religious Denomination: SJGHC values the religious beliefs of those for whom we care.  Should you indicate on admission that you wish to be visited by a hospital endorsed representative of your religious denomination during your stay, your details will be given to the relevant chaplain, minister or cleric to enable this service to be provided.  You may withdraw your consent at any time.

2. Employees: 

SJGHC collects, uses and discloses personal information about its staff in order to perform its obligations as an employer and as required by law. However, the handling of past and current employee records are exempt from the Privacy Act where there is a direct relationship between SJGHC and the past/current employee.  SJGHC will retain your employee records confidentially and in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009, which sets out your entitlements in relation to these documents.  

3. Students, volunteers and job applicants:

We also collect personal information of job applicants, students and volunteers for the primary purpose of assessing their suitability for employment or undertaking work experience or clinical placement or providing other relevant assistance, as the case may be. Other purposes for which we may use personal information about those individuals include to contact them, for insurance purposes and to satisfy our legal obligations.  We may store information provided by unsuccessful job applicants to send job alerts for future recruitment, where they have consented to this. 

4. Health professionals, contractors and suppliers:

SJGHC collects personal information about contractors, suppliers and health professionals that provide services to SJGHC for the primary purpose of assessing, accrediting and engaging their services or expertise and for other purposes where legally required.  Personal information about certain health professionals is also collected, used and disclosed for their accreditation under the credentialing process set out in SJGHC’s By-Laws for Health Professionals.

"THE WESTERN HEALTH FOUNDATION: New Victorian Access Policy for Specialist Clinics
GPs will start to see some differences in the communication received from Western Health specialist
clinics. The changes in communication processes, as outlined below, are a result of the
implementation of the Department of Health’s Specialist Clinics in Victorian Public Hospitals: Access
Policy, released 2013.
Key points for GPs
Referrals to specialist clinics should contain all the relevant demographic and clinical information as
well as results from preliminary investigations. Such referrals can be efficiently triaged for urgency
and added to a waitlist, and can reduce patient waiting times.
Specialist clinics should communicate with referrers about referrals and the outcomes of specialist
reviews within set time frames, which will help with ongoing care management in the community.
The Policy has three main areas of focus:
 Timeframes for the completion of key processes relating to specialist clinics
 Increased data transparency - implementing a centralised monitoring of access to specialist
clinics and other aspects of service performance, hopefully leading to the government
releasing information about specialist clinic waiting lists
 To improve communication between referrers and clinics in a way that manages
expectations and is beneficial to both parties
Timeframes for implementation
The Policy has a two year implementation phase with full compliance expected by all health services
by 1 July 2015. As outlined in the table below Western Health has begun implementing the changes.
Western Health is committed to keeping you informed of the changes as we move towards full
implementation of the Policy.
What does the Policy mean for you and your patients?
 Clear minimum standard for all referrals
 Clear expectations regarding timelines for processing referrals
 Clear expectations regarding when to expect communication regarding outcome of referral
 Improved access to pre-referral information including pre-referral guidelines
 Improved communication from specialist clinics following appointments
Major changes at Western Health in line with the Policy
Referrals for specialist clinics must contain all the information outlined below.

Indigenous status and interpreter needs

Referrer details Name, contact information, referrer provider number and
signature
Referral details Date of referral, name of specialist clinic, if known and name of
specialist to whom the patient is being referred.
A named specialist is required for all referrals to MBS clinics
As per the Policy, referrals that don’t include all the information as outlined above will be returned to
the referring doctor with a request for more information. Referrals that are awaiting further information
will remain ‘open’ for 30 days. If a new referral with the requested information is not received by the
Specialist Clinics within 30 days the referral will be not accepted.

"Cabrini Health Ltd.: What information does Cabrini collect about me?
When you become a patient at Cabrini a medical record is created containing information such as your name, address, contact details, general practitioner (GP), the nature of the problem you are seeking treatment for, investigations and advice you have been given during your treatment. Every time you attend Cabrini as an inpatient or for healthcare services, new information is added to your record.

If you visit a private doctor’s suite at a Cabrini site or elsewhere, they maintain their own records about your health and are kept separately.

Why is information collected?
Cabrini collects health information to ensure that you receive the best possible care and treatment. Your medical history enables us to provide all health professionals involved in your care with up to date information. To help us look after your health we ask that you provide us with accurate and complete information.

Protecting your privacy
Information about you is stored in a central (acute or rehabilitation) paper medical record, which is stored securely within the Health Information Services Department or at a secure offsite storage facility. We also keep information about you on our computer system, which is protected from misuse, loss, interference and unauthorised access. Information that is captured electronically by Cabrini staff is stored on-site in central Cabrini systems. These systems are available to clinical staff to manage your care. When patient data is accessed electronically, there is an audit trail of who has accessed the data and when access occurred. This audit trail occurs regardless of whether the device used is a mobile or a desktop device. If accessing via a mobile device, there are three standard security features implemented.

Cabrini maintains strict policies regarding who has the authority to access your information and all of our staff must abide by the Cabrini confidentiality policy. The Health Records Act 2001 (Victoria) and the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) govern the collection, use and disclosure, access to, and correction of, health information, as well as the security and retention of medical records in private hospitals in Victoria.

Cabrini is committed to upholding our obligations in regard to the Australian Privacy Principles. Our Privacy Policies reflect updates to the Privacy Act 1988 by the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 with effect from 12 March 2014.

What happens with my information?
While you are an inpatient, general information about your condition may be provided to your next of kin or a near relative unless you request otherwise.

When you go home after an inpatient visit a letter may be sent to your General Practitioner (GP). The letter summarises your time at Cabrini and may include information such as your treatment, medication and any special instructions. If you do not wish this information to be sent to your doctor please let the admission staff (Patient Services) or your nurse know as soon as possible.

Another hospital, community health provider or doctor may contact us to obtain information about you so that they can continue your ongoing care. Please inform us as soon as possible if you would like to request that information not be provided to a particular person or organisation.

Your personal information will also be sent to your health fund as allowed in the Private Health Insurance (Data Provision) Rules 2011(Cth).

Legislation also requires that certain information about patients who have specific conditions and treatments must be reported to databases or registers maintained by the Department of Health or other health organisations. Patient information recorded on the databases and registers is kept strictly confidential. There may also be occasions where Cabrini is obliged by or authorised under, law to disclose patient information, such as presentation of your medical record to a court when subpoenaed in the case of legal action.

At Cabrini, patients cannot elect to be anonymous or pseudonymous unless they pay their entire hospital’s expense up front. Anonymous or pseudonymous in this context means you are registered by any name and other demographic details you choose.

The information we collect about you can only be destroyed after a specified time period. All patient records are kept for a minimum of seven years as per legislation.

We may contact you before you are admitted to;

Check pre-admission details
To inform you of out-of-pocket expenses.
You may be contacted after you have gone home regarding;

Follow up from day procedure centre 12 - 24 hours post discharge
Follow up post delivery discharge.
How can I access my information?

"St John of God Health Care: St John of God Health Care Privacy Policy
Introduction
St John of God Health Care (SJGHC), including its Foundation, is committed to upholding the dignity of each person.  Guided by the value of respect, we will manage all personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme (NDB scheme) under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) and all other relevant Commonwealth and State legislation (together “Privacy Legislation”). This SJGHC Privacy Policy details how your personal information is collected, used, stored and disclosed by SJGHC and how you may contact us if you would like to access or correct your personal information. It also details how we respond if there is an Eligible Data Breach.

This privacy policy applies to all trading entities operated by SJGHC throughout Australia which are listed at www.sjog.org.au/contactus.  

A number of terms are used in this policy which have specific meanings as defined in the Privacy Act.

Personal information means “information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: 

whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.”
Some personal information is also classified as ‘sensitive information’. Sensitive information includes any personal information concerning a person’s race or ethnic origin, their political opinions, membership of political associations, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, biometric information used for automated biometric verification or biometric identification, biometric templates, health information and genetic information.  Sensitive information is afforded a higher degree of privacy protection and is subject to additional standards under the Privacy Act in relation to its handling.

Health information is a subset of personal information and is also considered to be sensitive information. Health information means: 

information or an opinion about:
the health, including an illness, disability or injury, (at any time) of an individual; or
an individual’s expressed wishes about the future provision of health services to him or her; or
a health service provided, or to be provided, to an individual; and other personal information collected to provide, or in providing, a health service to an individual; 
other personal information collected in connection with the donation, or intended donation, by an individual of his or her body parts, organs or body substances; or
genetic information about an individual in a form that is, or could be, predictive of the health of the individual or a genetic relative of the individual.
Eligible Data Breach has the meaning set out in the Privacy Act and generally means when there has been or is likely to be unauthorised access to, unauthorised disclosure of, or loss of, personal information held by an entity; and a reasonable person would conclude that the access, disclosure or loss is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates and no remedial action has been taken. 

Information collected by SJGHC 

SJGHC collects personal information about individuals including patients, their relatives, employees, job applicants, contractors, vendors and suppliers, health professionals, students, volunteers and Foundation supporters.

SJGHC will only collect and hold personal information that is reasonably necessary for the performance of its services or obligations as an employer or accreditor of health practitioners. As a patient, we may collect information about your health history, family history, lifestyle, cultural or ethnic background and test results to assist in providing health care to you.  

If you are employed by SJGHC or if you have applied for a position at one of our facilities, we will often collect information about your work history, contact details, referees and any other information that you might submit in your job application. 

We collect similar background information about contractors, vendors, suppliers and health professionals who provide services to SJGHC and also about students and volunteers that attend at our facilities.  Where required, information from police checks, working with children checks and pre-employment medical screenings may also be collected. 

SJGHC usually collects your personal information directly from you and with your consent.  We will only collect your personal information from someone else if we have your consent, or if it is authorised or required by law, or if it is unreasonable or impracticable for us to collect that information from you, for example, where your life is at risk and you are unable to respond and we need your personal information in order to provide emergency treatment.

Use and Disclosure 

SJGHC will only use or disclose your personal information for the primary purposes for which it was collected or for directly related secondary purposes which you would reasonably expect (or about which we have told you) or as permitted or required by law.  If there is any doubt about this expectation then we will obtain your consent before using or disclosing your personal information for a secondary purpose. Apart from the uses listed in this policy or otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act, using or disclosing your personal information will only be done with your consent.

Sections 1-5 below identify the purposes for which we collect your personal information and sets out how we may use or disclose your personal information.

1. Provision of SJGHC services:

Personal information, including sensitive information, is collected by us for the primary purpose of ensuring patients and clients receive quality services whilst under our care. Accordingly, this information may need to be shared with other relevant people. Where necessary, your personal information, including your health information, may be collected from or disclosed to other health care providers, such as your general practitioner, home service provider or district health nurse or another hospital that may be involved in your ongoing care and/or services. 
In addition, aspects of your personal information we collect may be used or disclosed for other purposes, including: 

(a) Other health professionals: Some of the services provided within or by our facilities may be outsourced or provided by a contractor (i.e. physiotherapists or outpatient services). We may provide your personal information to them in order to assist in your care. Further, if you require certain medical devices or a prosthesis for your treatment, we may disclose your personal information to suppliers or manufacturers of those devices.  We require all such health professionals and contractors to handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and this policy.

(b) Relatives, guardian or legal representative:  Unless you have advised us not to disclose your health information, we may provide information about your condition to your next of kin, nominated relative, guardian or appointed legal representative. 

(c) Quality assurance: From time to time, we may need to collect, use or disclose aspects of your personal information to monitor the standard of health services provided, through processes such as accreditation and evaluation, clinical audits, risk and claims management, education and training of staff, and quality assurance activities, including monitoring clinical outcomes. This may include obtaining information from other health service providers.

(d) Patient satisfaction: To ensure we are delivering our services to meet our patients’ needs, we monitor patient satisfaction. As a result, we, or someone we authorise, may contact you in the future to request your feedback on our services. 

(e) Health service management: To aid the functioning of the health service, personal information of SJGHC patients may be used or disclosed to your health fund, Medicare and also to insurers, lawyers and your doctor for claims management.  This may include providing your information to other advisers in the ordinary course of managing our business, to support administrative functions incidental to providing the health services. 

(f) Billing: For billing and invoicing purposes, we may share relevant aspects of your personal information with third parties such as your other health care providers, Medicare, your private health insurance fund or external collection or account management agencies.

(g) Contractors: Depending on the requirements and resources available to SJGHC from time to time, we may engage third parties (such as IT suppliers, advisors and other professional service providers) to help us carry out our functions and activities and we may need to use and disclose your personal information in relation to these services. We require all such contractors to handle your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and where applicable this policy.

(h) Data required by law: We have legal obligations to provide information to various entities, for example if your medical record is subpoenaed or for compulsory reporting to State and Federal authorities. We may also provide your personal and health information to government agencies where we are providing health services under contracts with Government as required under those contracts. More information regarding these obligations is available on request.

(i) Direct marketing: We would like to use your personal information to contact you to provide marketing or promotional information in relation to other services we offer.  We will always comply with the privacy law when using or disclosing information for marketing purposes. If you would prefer not to be contacted, you may indicate this at any time.  

(j) St John of God Foundation (fundraising): As a not-for-profit group, SJGHC returns all profits to the community. The St John of God Foundation raises funds on behalf of SJGHC and relies on the generous support of the community to enable the delivery of better health outcomes, such as medical research, social outreach programs and major capital developments.  Therefore, we use our patients’ personal information to allow the St John of God Foundation, or someone it authorises, to contact you to provide information related to fundraising or community projects.  If you would prefer not to receive this information, you can indicate this.

(k) Research: SJGHC is committed to conducting research across a wide range of health fields with the aim of improving patient outcomes, public health and safety and teaching and otherwise as set out in the Privacy Act. SJGHC may use your health information for this purpose, which generally includes information contained in existing patient data, medical records and diagnoses by private specialists you have seen in the past. Only authorised persons will have access to your information.  We will not disclose your identity to unauthorised persons. 

(l) Religious Denomination: SJGHC values the religious beliefs of those for whom we care.  Should you indicate on admission that you wish to be visited by a hospital endorsed representative of your religious denomination during your stay, your details will be given to the relevant chaplain, minister or cleric to enable this service to be provided.  You may withdraw your consent at any time.

2. Employees: 

SJGHC collects, uses and discloses personal information about its staff in order to perform its obligations as an employer and as required by law. However, the handling of past and current employee records are exempt from the Privacy Act where there is a direct relationship between SJGHC and the past/current employee.  SJGHC will retain your employee records confidentially and in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009, which sets out your entitlements in relation to these documents.  

3. Students, volunteers and job applicants:

We also collect personal information of job applicants, students and volunteers for the primary purpose of assessing their suitability for employment or undertaking work experience or clinical placement or providing other relevant assistance, as the case may be. Other purposes for which we may use personal information about those individuals include to contact them, for insurance purposes and to satisfy our legal obligations.  We may store information provided by unsuccessful job applicants to send job alerts for future recruitment, where they have consented to this. 

4. Health professionals, contractors and suppliers:

SJGHC collects personal information about contractors, suppliers and health professionals that provide services to SJGHC for the primary purpose of assessing, accrediting and engaging their services or expertise and for other purposes where legally required.  Personal information about certain health professionals is also collected, used and disclosed for their accreditation under the credentialing process set out in SJGHC’s By-Laws for Health Professionals.

Our contact details
What personal information do we collect?
If you are a patient, we will collect your personal information so that we can provide health services and other services to you.  This could include your name, date of birth and contact details, and your medical history.

Sometimes we need to collect personal information from other people who deal with us.  For example, job applicants, service providers, carers and emergency contacts for patients.

How do we collect your personal information?
We will collect personal information directly from you where it is practical to do so.

Sometimes we need to collect your information from someone else. We will only do this:

with your consent; or
where it is not practical to obtain this information from you and this is otherwise permitted by the privacy laws.
For example, if you are a patient, we may need to collect your information from your GP or family member where there is a serious threat to your life or health and you cannot provide consent.

How do we use your personal information?
We will generally only use your personal information for the main purposes for which you provided it to us.

If you are a patient, we will generally only use your personal information so we can provide health services to you.

We may also use your personal information for purposes which are directly related to the main purpose for which the information was collected. We will only do this in circumstances where you would reasonably expect us to use your information for these purposes.

Patient Privacy Notice

 Date last reviewed: Nov 2014
PRIVACY POLICY
Waikiki Private Hospital respects and upholds individual’s rights to privacy protection in accordance with the
Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988. This privacy policy explains how personal
information is collected, held, used, disclosed, secured and otherwise managed, including patient health
information. It describes the types of information collected and held by the hospital, the purposes for which it
is collected, how to access and correct the information and how to make a privacy complaint.
Personal, sensitive and health information are defined in the Privacy Act as follows:
Personal information means ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is
reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or
opinion is recorded in a material form or not’.
Sensitive information is a type of personal information that is afforded a higher level of protection by the
Privacy Act. It includes health, genetic and biometric information as well as information about race or ethnic
origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations or trade unions, religious
beliefs, sexual orientation or practices and criminal record.
Health information, a subset of personal information is also considered to be sensitive information and
includes information or an opinion:
· about an individual’s health or disability at any time (that is, past, present or future);
· about an individual’s expressed wishes regarding future health services;
· regarding health services provided, or to be provided, to the individual;
· collected whilst providing a health service; or
· collected in connection with the donation or intended donation of body parts and substances.
· information about physical or biological samples, where it can be linked to an individual (for example, where
they have a name or identifier attached); and
· genetic information, when this is collected or used in connection with delivering a health service, or genetic

Storage and security of personal information
Waikiki Private Hospital stores personal and health information in both paper and electronic form and takes all
reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses, is accurate, complete
and up-to-date.
The hospital takes steps to protect the personal information it holds against interference, misuse, loss and

area located at the hospital and off-site at an ISO 9001 Certified document storage facility. Personal
information is also contained in hospital databases in a secure environment; and such records are only
accessible by authorised persons who require access to the personal information for the purpose of carrying
out their duties of employment.
The hospital uses technologies and processes such as access control, network firewalls, centralised antivirus
systems, encryption and physical security measures to protect individuals’ privacy.

Access to and correction of personal information
Individuals may request access to the personal information the hospital holds about them. Requests should be

be provided with written notice of the decision, including reasons for denial and how to complain if the
individual is not satisfied with the decision.

apply but once the request is approved, an administration, photocopying and courier/delivery fee may be
charged.
Personal information the hospital gives access to, will be disclosed to the individual’s authorised representative
or legal adviser where the hospital has been given written authority to do so.
Waikiki Private Hospital takes reasonable steps to correct the personal information it holds if it is satisfied that
it is inaccurate, incomplete and out of date, irrelevant or misleading. If a patient believes that the personal
information the hospital holds needs to be corrected, a ‘Request to Amend Patient Information’ form is to be
completed (available by contacting the hospital). The hospital will take all steps to record the corrections and
place them with the patient’s record but under no circumstances does the hospital erase or remove the
original clinical information.
There may be circumstances in which corrections may have to be refused. If this happens, the individual will
be notified in writing of the reasons for the refusal and an explanation provided detailing how they can
complain if they are not satisfied.

The hospital uses technologies and processes such as access control, network firewalls, centralised antivirus
systems, encryption and physical security measures to protect individuals’ privacy.
Personal and health information is retained for the period of time determined by applicable Australian laws
after which it is de-identified or disposed of in a secure manner.
Access to and correction of personal information
Individuals may request access to the personal information the hospital holds about them. Requests should be
made in writing and patients are required to complete a ‘Request to Access Patient Information’ form,
available by contacting the hospital.
Access may be denied to some or all of the personal information in certain circumstances allowed by the
Privacy Act or other applicable laws. If Waikiki Private Hospital refuses a request for access, the individual will
be provided with written notice of the decision, including reasons for denial and how to complain if the
individual is not satisfied with the decision.
The hospital endeavours to give access to an individual’s personal information in the form they request.
However if that is not possible an alternative means of access will be provided. An application fee does not
apply but once the request is approved, an administration, photocopying and courier/delivery fee may be
charged.
Personal information the hospital gives access to, will be disclosed to the individual’s authorised representative
or legal adviser where the hospital has been given written authority to do so.
Waikiki Private Hospital takes reasonable steps to correct the personal information it holds if it is satisfied that
it is inaccurate, incomplete and out of date, irrelevant or misleading. If a patient believes that the personal
information the hospital holds needs to be corrected, a ‘Request to Amend Patient Information’ form is to be
completed (available by contacting the hospital). The hospital will take all steps to record the corrections and
place them with the patient’s record but under no circumstances does the hospital erase or remove the
original clinical information.
There may be circumstances in which corrections may have to be refused. If this happens, the individual will
be notified in writing of the reasons for the refusal and an explanation provided detailing how they can
complain if they are not satisfied.

"Teres Hospital:The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

"Rigshospitalets Blodbank:Account Information: When you create a Yelp account, we store and use the information you provide during that process, such as the first and last name you enter, email address, zip code, physical address, and any other information you may provide during the account creation process, such as a gender, phone number, or birth date. We may publicly display the first name and last initial that you provide, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the account creation process, as part of your account profile. We also store and use any preferences you provide to personalize your user experience, including dining and activity preferences. You can later modify some of the account information you provide through your account settings. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account using your personal information, you can request its removal by flagging it.
Public Content: Your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, Collections, compliments, Ask the Community posts, Yelp Talk posts, and edits to business page information. Your account profile (e.g., first name, last initial, city, neighborhood, the month and year you created your Yelp account, profile photos and list of friends on Yelp) is also intended for public consumption, as is some of your other activity through the Service, like how you vote on other people’s contributions (e.g., useful, funny, cool, helpful, or not helpful), which contributions you like, where you check-in (including when friends on Yelp tag you in their own check-ins), which contributions or users you follow, and which businesses you follow or bookmark. You can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your account settings.
Contacts: You can invite others to join or become your friend on Yelp by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we will transmit information about your contacts to our servers long enough to process your invitations.
Communications: When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other users, businesses, and Yelp. You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Yelp. For example, if you make a reservation, order food, place yourself on a waitlist, or request a quote from a business through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages, and share that information with other parties to your messages (for example, to let them know if you have viewed their message). When a user requests a quote or similar information from multiple businesses through the Service, we may disclose to those businesses information about the status of the user’s requests, such as whether any business has responded to the request, the type of response provided (for example, a quote or a request for more information), and whether the user has responded to any business’s reply. If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. If you are a representative of a business listed on Yelp, or use a phone number associated now or previously with such a business, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business. Our communications with you, including phone calls, may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.
Transactions: If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation or purchase, we will collect and store information you provide associated with your transaction, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information, as well as any other information you provide, in order to process your transaction, send communications about the transaction to you, and facilitate future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers and other sensitive payment information, that information is encrypted using industry standard technology. If you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses in connection with such reviews. For example, if you make a dining reservation through the Service and later write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your reservation through the Service.
Activity: We store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visits, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and reservations, purchases, or transactions you make through the Service. We also store information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs and mobile applications. We may also receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such information in the course of using the Service. You may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the settings for our applications in iOS or Android privacy settings.
Different Devices: You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or personal computer) and different platforms (e.g., the Yelp website or Yelp mobile apps). The information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one Yelp platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all other Yelp platforms.
Professional Information: If you represent a business on Yelp, we may collect and display information about you related to your business activities, such as a business name that may incorporate your name, or a publicly available business address that is also used as a home address. We will also collect and display information about your professional background that you choose to share with us through the Service, such as information about your professional licenses or certifications, or your professional history or specialties. 
Legal Basis for Processing (EEA and Switzerland only): For European Residents, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the specific information concerned and the context in which we collect it. We, however, will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for instance, to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations). If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate our Services, communicate with you in relation to our Services, or for our other legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, to analyze and improve our platform, engage in marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing fraud.

"Capio Privathospital Odense Our Pledge Regarding Your Medical Information
Johns Hopkins is committed to protecting the privacy of medical
information we create or obtain about you. This Notice tells you
about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical
information about you. It also describes your rights and certain
obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of your
medical information. We are required by law to: (i) make sure your
medical information is protected; (ii) give you this Notice
describing our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to
your medical information; and (iii) follow the terms of the Notice
that is currently in effect.
Who Will Follow This Notice
The privacy practices described in this Notice will be followed by
all health care professionals, employees, medical staff, trainees,
students and volunteers of the Johns Hopkins organizations
specified at the end of this Notice.
How We May Use and Disclose Medical
Information About You
The following sections describe different ways we may use and
disclose your medical information. We abide by all applicable
laws related to the protection of this information. Not every use
or disclosure will be listed. All of the ways we are permitted to
use and disclose information, however, will fall within one of the
following categories:
Treatment. We may use or disclose medical information about
you to provide you with medical treatment or services. For
example, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know
if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing
process. We may also share medical information about you with
other Johns Hopkins personnel or non-Johns Hopkins health care
providers, agencies or facilities in order to provide or coordinate
the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and
X-rays, or transportation.
Payment. We may use and disclose medical information about you
so that the treatment and services you receive at Johns Hopkins or
from others, such as an ambulance company, may be billed to you
and payment collected from you, an insurance company or another
third party. For exae, we may need to give information to your
health insurance company about surgery you received at Johns
Hopkins so your health insurance company will pay us or
reimburse you for the surgery.
Health care operations. We may use and disclose medical
information about you for Johns Hopkins operations. These uses
and disclosures are made to enhance quality of care and for
medical staff activities, Johns Hopkins health-sciences education
and other teaching programs, and general business activities. For
example, we may disclose information to doctors, nurses,
technicians, medical and other students, and other Johns Hopkins
personnel for performance improvement and educational purposes
or we may share information with Johns Hopkins corporate
security to maintain the safety of our facilities.
Health information exchange. We may share information that
we obtain or create about you with other health care providers or
other health care entities, such as your health plan or health
insurer, as permitted by law, through Health Information
Exchanges (HIEs) in which we participate. For example,
information about your past medical care and current medical
conditions and medications can be available to us or to your nonJohns Hopkins primary care physician or hospital, if they
participate in the HIE as well. Exchange of health information can
provide faster access, better coordination of care and assist
providers and public health officials in making more informed
decisions.
The Chesapeake Regional Information System for Our Patients,
Inc. (CRISP), is a regional Internet-based HIE in which we
participate. We may share information about you through CRISP
for treatment, payment, health care operations, or research
purposes. You may opt out of CRISP and disable access to your
health information available through CRISP by contacting CRISP
at 1-877-952-7477 or completing and submitting an Opt-Out form
to CRISP by mail, fax, or through their website at crisphealth.org.
Even if you opt-out of CRISP, public health reporting and
Controlled Dangerous Substances information, as part of the State
Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), will still be
available to providers through CRISP as permitted by law.
Your hospital or health care provider may also participate in other
HIEs, including HIEs that allow your provider to share your
information directly through our electronic medical record system.
You may choose to opt-out of these other HIEs by calling the
MyChart Help Desk at 1-800-318-4246.

It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may publicly display the first name and last initial that you provide, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the account creation process, as part of your account profile. We also store and use any preferences you provide to personalize your user experience, including dining and activity preferences. You can later modify some of the account information you provide through your account settings. If you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account using your personal information, you can request its removal by flagging it.
Public Content: Your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, Collections, compliments, Ask the Community posts, Yelp Talk posts, and edits to business page information. Your account profile (e.g., first name, last initial, city, neighborhood, the month and year you created your Yelp account, profile photos and list of friends on Yelp) is also intended for public consumption, as is some of your other activity through the Service, like how you vote on other people’s contributions (e.g., useful, funny, cool, helpful, or not helpful), which contributions you like, where you check-in (including when friends on Yelp tag you in their own check-ins), which contributions or users you follow, and which businesses you follow or bookmark. You can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your account settings.
Contacts: You can invite others to join or become your friend on Yelp by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we will transmit information about your contacts to our servers long enough to process your invitations.
Communications: When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other users, businesses, and Yelp. You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Yelp. For example, if you make a reservation, order food, place yourself on a waitlist, or request a quote from a business through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages, and share that information with other parties to your messages (for example, to let them know if you have viewed their message). When a user requests a quote or similar information from multiple businesses through the Service, we may disclose to those businesses information about the status of the user’s requests, such as whether any business has responded to the request, the type of response provided (for example, a quote or a request for more information), and whether the user has responded to any business’s reply. If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. If you are a representative of a business listed on Yelp, or use a phone number associated now or previously with such a business, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business. Our communications with you, including phone calls, may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.
Transactions: If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation or purchase, we will collect and store information you provide associated with your transaction, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information, as well as any other information you provide, in order to process your transaction, send communications about the transaction to you, and facilitate future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers and other sensitive payment information, that information is encrypted using industry standard technology. If you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses in connection with such reviews. For example, if you make a dining reservation through the Service and later write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your reservation through the Service.
Activity: We store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visits, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and reservations, purchases, or transactions you make through the Service.

You may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the settings for our applications in iOS or Android privacy settings.
Different Devices: You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or personal computer) and different platforms (e.g., the Yelp website or Yelp mobile apps). The information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one Yelp platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all other Yelp platforms.
Professional Information: If you represent a business on Yelp, we may collect and display information about you related to your business activities, such as a business name that may incorporate your name, or a publicly available business address that is also used as a home address. We will also collect and display information about your professional background that you choose to share with us through the Service, such as information about your professional licenses or certifications, or your professional history or specialties. 
Legal Basis for Processing (EEA and Switzerland only): For European Residents, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the specific information concerned and the context in which we collect it.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for instance, to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations). If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
